## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### Top 5 Risks

**1. AI API Costs (Gemini)**
- **Risk:** High usage could exceed margins
- **Mitigation:** Aggressive caching (30-day TTL), queue system, upgrade pricing to offset

**2. Low Paid Conversion**
- **Risk:** Users get value from free tier, don't upgrade
- **Mitigation:** Hard limits (1 deck, 50 contacts), upsell prompts, email drip campaigns

**3. Competitor Clones**
- **Risk:** Low barrier to entry, big tech could copy
- **Mitigation:** Network effects (investor database), rapid feature velocity, vertical specialization

**4. AI Content Quality**
- **Risk:** Gemini generates low-quality decks, users lose trust
- **Mitigation:** Human review prompts, feedback loops (thumbs up/down), continuous prompt engineering

**5. GDPR/Data Privacy**
- **Risk:** Handling investor contacts could trigger compliance issues
- **Mitigation:** RLS on all tables, GDPR-compliant policies, data export/delete features
